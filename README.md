# LeopardSpot

The LeopardSpot project aims to develop a web-based application that provides real-time parking lot availability information for the various parking lots at WIT (Wentworth Institute of Technology). The application will enable commuters to efficiently locate available parking spots on campus, enhancing their overall parking experience. To better showcase LeopardSpot there will be a miniature parking lot with model cars that will help demonstrate the use of the app.
